Creating a more dynamic IT infrastructure has many potential challenges. Here are a few:

1. Cost: Transitioning from a static to a dynamic IT infrastructure can require substantial upfront investment in new hardware, software, and possibly training for personnel.

2. Complexity: Dynamic infrastructures often require more complex management systems. This complexity can result in increased risk of failures or security breaches if not properly managed.

3. Skillset: Implementing and managing a dynamic infrastructure requires a different skillset than managing a traditional, static infrastructure. Existing IT teams may require significant training, or entirely new personnel may need to be hired.

4. Resistance to Change: Like any change in an organization, moving to a dynamic IT infrastructure can encounter resistance from personnel. This can slow down the transition process.

5. Integration with existing systems: It can be a challenge to integrate dynamic infrastructure with existing legacy systems. This can result in temporary or longer-term disruptions for users.

6. Scalability: While dynamic infrastructures are meant to be scalable, determining the right scale for your business and adjusting the infrastructure to meet shifts in demand can be difficult. 

7. Security: Dynamic environments can present unique security challenges, as the constantly changing environment can be harder to monitor and protect.

8. Vendor lock-in: While transitioning to a dynamic infrastructure, companies might rely on certain vendors for their services. However, this can lead to a situation where changing vendors or services may become difficult and expensive in the future.

9. Migration Challenges: Existing applications and services might not easily migrate onto the new dynamic infrastructure, causing potential operational issues.

10. Performance: While virtualization and automation can offer better use of resources, they can sometimes lead to performance issues if not properly managed.

It's important that organizations do a comprehensive assessment of these challenges and make a well-planned strategy to overcome these issues while shifting to a more dynamic infrastructure.
